              <h3>steel frames RC Frame</h3>
              <p style={{ lineHeight: "25px", textAlign: "justify" }}>
                From flat developments to car parks, RC frames use reinforced
                concrete structures and advanced machinery to undertake complex
                more complex projects. Often RC frames are used for restricted
                areas.

              <h3>steel Frame</h3>
              <p>
                Steel frames are a very high strength yet low weight way to form
                the structure of a building. Most commonly steel frames are used
                to span over large distances such as high rise properties,
                industrial warehousing and other superstructures.

                <h3>ICF (Insulated Concrete Form)</h3>
                <p style={{ lineHeight: "25px", textAlign: "justify" }}>
                  This method is unique in the sense that it requires on site
                  building; concrete is poured into a hollow frame which is then
                  reinforced with steel. ICF is a popular choice for residential
                  developments as it energy efficient and provides a great layer
                  of insulation.
                </p>
                <h3>Concrete Frame</h3>
                <p>
                  Typically used on concrete foundations, concrete frames
                  consist of a network of beams which form the structure of a
                  building. Concrete frames are a particularly heavyweight
                  option which are used to support the weight of floors, roofs
                  and walls.

              <h3>Structural Openings</h3>
              <p style={{ lineHeight: "25px", textAlign: "justify" }}>
                Structural openings are often necessary to support the wall
                surrounding any new openings. This helps with the stability of
                the property and the support of the structure above.
              </p>
              <h3>Portal Frames</h3>
              <p>
                This method is most often used on low structures such as
                industrial units and retail properties. Portal frames use
                columns which are connected together and are popular for large
                areas.
