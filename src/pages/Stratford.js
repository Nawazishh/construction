            Waterproofing – effective waterproofing avoids common water drainage
            issues often faced in the basement and is even recommended if you

            Foundations – Professionally implemented basement foundations are

            Underpinning – It is crucial to strengthen the foundations of a
            property when undertaking a basement conversion, skipping the
            underpinning process will leave your home at risk of damage or even
            collapse.
